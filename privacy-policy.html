        Cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your device's hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes.

There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.

        Session Cookies. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your device when you close your browser or turn off your device. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site, App and Services.

            We use the following types of cookies (collectively, “Cookie Data”):

            “Essential Cookies” are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. Because of their essential nature, you cannot opt out of these cookies.
            “Functional Cookies” enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages.
            “Analytics Cookies” allow us to count visits and traffic sources, so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous.
            Additionally, “Advertising Cookies” may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites.

                <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
                <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to
                    post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or
                    company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting
                    Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy
                    on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies
                    with whom it is being shared. - See more at

                    <p>8 Your California Rights
                        The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California residents with the following rights:

The right to request we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information (as used in this section “Personal Information” has the definition set forth in CCPA) over the past 12 months, upon verifiable consumer request. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you: (i) the categories of Personal Information we collected about you, (ii) the categories of sources for the Personal Information we collected about you, (iii) our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that Personal Information, (iv) the categories of third parties with whom we disclosed or sold that Personal Information, (v) and/or the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you (also called a data portability request). You may make a “request to know” up to two times in a 12-month period free of charge, subject to limitations described in the law. A general description of the categories of information that we collect, the purpose for collecting, using and sharing such information, and types of service providers we share information with is set forth above in the “Information and Collection,” “Legal Basis, Use and Retention of Information” and “Third Party Data Processors and Services Providers” sections.
