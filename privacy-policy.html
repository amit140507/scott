<h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>

    CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.

    Users can visit our site anonymously.

    Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.</p>
